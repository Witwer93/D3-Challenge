# D3-Challenge

Greatest challenge was getting correct placement for axis labels and circle labels.
Interesting how selectAll(null) works to catch the text entries that have yet to be filled.
Hoping I get to come back and add in the bonus segment.

As of now I have yet to work on the bonus part of this assignment.
